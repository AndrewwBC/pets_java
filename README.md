# Spring Boot - Back-end of Pets4Ever - A brief doc.

This was my very first use of Spring Boot. As soon as I learned how to use, I decided to use in this project. I'll show here some features in this back-end.

## API REST

The API was documented with swagger: https://api.pets4ever.site/swagger-ui/index.html

## Handling Exceptions

Is really usefull in orden to create responses that can be understood by the user, like email already in use.

## Cookies

Cookies are safier than local storage, it can't be modified with JS.
